# üõ∞Ô∏èSatellite-Dispatch

The Satellite-Dispatch is an CrewAI-driven platform designed to facilitate disaster response and recovery efforts using satellite technology. This project aims to harness the capabilities of various types of satellites, including Earth observation, weather monitoring, communication, and navigation satellites, to support emergency responders and authorities in mitigating the impact of natural disasters.

## Overview

The Satellite Emergency Response System comprises a set of AI agents simulating different types of satellites and a central control system for coordinating satellite operations during and after a disaster. These AI agents are responsible for tasks such as capturing imagery, monitoring weather conditions, maintaining communication, providing navigation services, recording satellite actions, and compiling post-disaster reports.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/buaa-ysw/Satellite-Dispatch.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Select the model in `config.ini` and modify the `.env.example` file.

4. Run the application:

```
python main.py
```

5. Input a disaster to run.

## Example

```
*[November 8, 2013]* A major natural disaster, including strong winds, heavy rainfall, storm surge, landslides, and flash floods, has struck multiple regions, causing widespread damage and displacing numerous residents.
```
